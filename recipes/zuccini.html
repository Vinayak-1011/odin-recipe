    </p>
    <p> Step wise guide,
        Mix rice flour with water, egg and seasonings, set aside to hydrate while you prepare the veggies.
        Cut zucchini into narrow strips- spiraling or grating works too.  Cut scallions in strips by slicing in quarters long ways, creating strips about 4-5 inches long.
        Mix zucchini, scallions and any other veggies into the rice flour batter.  The water has a tendency to separate from the batter- make sure you scrape the bottom of the bowl when you mix.
        Spread a thin layer of batter and veggies on a cast iron or well-seasoned pan.  It is easier to flip if you keep the pancake no larger than 6 or 7 inches.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Cook for about 3 minutes on each side, until golden.
        Serve with kimchi and soy dipping sauce.
